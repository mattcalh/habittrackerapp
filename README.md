# Overview

The Habit Tracker is a mobile app built using Flutter, designed to work seamlessly on both IOS and Android platforms. This app is designed to help users keep track of their daily goals and habits. By tracking their habits, users can assess their daily performance and efficiency.

To use the app, users must first create a new account and verify their email address. Once logged in, users can access the main page where they can create, delete, and edit habits. Editing and deleting can be done by swiping left with their finger to reveal the relevant buttons.

The app also has other pages such as Settings and Profile view, but these are currently under construction.
